# Use-Powershell

## Overview

ðŸ‘‹

I am finally working in an [environment](http://www.stackoverflow.com) that uses powershell. Like most I knew of it and had my share of biases. But it wasn't until I started using it that I realized how great PowerShell is and how much I love it.

I spent most of my career in Unix and Linux which meant I learned a LOT of bash.  Jeffrey Snover does an amazing job of [summarizing the flaws](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/monad-manifesto-the-origin-of-windows-powershell/) with the UNIX environment despite using it as a model for PowerShell.  So what I am saying is if you like the UNIX Philosophy, guess what?  Powershell is based on it.  

I invite you to open yourself up to the possibility that Powershell is an improvement.  

## Usage

While I have long abandoned trying to use Linux as a desktop, I still found myself customizing the experience and the tools to feel like bash.  This repository is a personal guide for me to stop doing bash things and start doing powershell things.

This use-powershell uses [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) for Jupyter style notebooks.
